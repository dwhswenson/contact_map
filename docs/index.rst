``contact_map``
===============

This package provides tools for analyzing and exploring contacts
(residue-residue and atom-atom) from a trajectory generated by molecular
dynamics. It builds on the excellent tools provided by `MDTraj
<http://mdtraj.org>`_.

Contacts can be an important tool for defining (meta)stable states in
processes involving biomolecules. For example, an analysis of contacts can
be particularly useful when defining bound states during a binding processes
between proteins, DNA, and small molecules (such as potential drugs).

The contacts analyzed by ``contact_map`` can be either intermolecular or
intramolecular, and can be analyzed on a residue-residue basis or an
atom-atom basis.

This package makes it very easy to answer questions like:

* What contacts are present in a trajectory?
* Which contacts are most common in a trajectory?
* What is the difference between the frequency of contacts in one trajectory
  and another?  (Or with a specific frame, such as a PDB entry.)
* For a particular residue-residue contact pair of interest, which atoms are
  most frequently in contact?

It also facilitates visualization of the contact matrix, with colors
representing the fraction of trajectory time that the contact was present.
